Workflow: Managing Concurrency
Objective
The goal of this workflow is to demonstrate how to manage concurrency in GitHub Actions, ensuring that only one instance of a workflow runs at a time for a specific branch.
Workflow Structure
1. Trigger Event
The workflow is triggered manually using workflow_dispatch. This allows the workflow to be started only when you manually trigger it.
