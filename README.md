If youâ€™re wondering what this portfolio is all about, itâ€™s my way of showcasing my skills and progress on GitHub. Yes, Iâ€™m new to the platform, 
and understanding how it all works has been a steep learning curve. But thereâ€™s always room to grow, learn, and explore new things.

When I first started using GitHub, I didnâ€™t know anything about Actions, workflows, pulls, dispatches, pushes, or any of the technicalities. It was all a mystery to me.

Feel free to browse through my portfolio. You might already be way ahead of me, but hey, everyone has to start somewhere! ðŸ˜Š
