Workflow Structure

Defining Concurrency






(https://github.com/cjhubgit/github-actions-portfolio/blob/0c95898288640d98fe15e538b157bcb98860a815/Defining%20concurrency.jpg)



The concurrency feature is used to limit workflow runs. This prevents multiple instances of the workflow from running simultaneously.	

Explanation:
•	${{ github.workflow }}: Refers to the name of the workflow file (9-1 Managing Concurrency), ensuring the workflow name is part of the concurrency group.
•	${{ github.ref }}: Refers to the branch or tag reference (e.g., main). This ensures concurrency is scoped to a specific branch or tag.
